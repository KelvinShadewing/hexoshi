========================================================================


Any contributions to this project should be based on the latest revision
found in the Git repository. This repository can be found here:

https://savannah.nongnu.org/git/?group=hexoshi

This document is designed to help you understand how to make changes,
how to run the version of the game from the repo, and how to forward
your changes upstream.


MAKING CHANGES

To make changes to the main game program, simply edit "hexoshi.py".  If
you like, you can add your own copyright notice to the top of the file.

To add any sort of game data, place it in the appropriate section of the
"data" directory, and add licensing information to "data/LICENSES".
Note: Any data contribution which is not given a proper libre license
WILL BE REJECTED.  Please adhere to the formatting of the rest of the
entries in the LICENSES file as closely as possible.

Whatever your contributions, please ensure that you add your name to
data/credits.json in the appropriate section(s). Make sure to test your
modification of this file with the "Credits" option from the main menu
of the game.


RUNNING THE GAME

Running the version of the game from the repo is similar to running the
source code releases, but the main difference is that dependencies are
not included.  The main dependencies are:

- SGE Game Engine - http://stellarengine.nongnu.org
- xSGE - http://xsge.nongnu.org
- Six - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six

Of course, all dependencies of these libraries must also be installed.

Note: The version of xsge_tmx needed by the game has not been released
yet.  Please use the latest Git revision of xsge_tmx in the meantime.


FORWARDING YOUR CHANGES

To forward your changes, please clone the Git repo, push it to your own
Git repo (any Git service will do), and send me a link to your repo.
