msgid ""
"Yeah, and now it's going to end! He should have thought about that "

msgid ""
"Fish?! I will not allow you to overthrow the great king over a tax! Your "

msgid "Who are you?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I am Tux, and I am putting an end to the Snow King's reign, one castle at "
"a time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's too bad, Tux. I would have liked to let you leave in peace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So it is you! The rebellious penguin who would see to it that our king's "

msgstr ""

msgid "I'm sorry to inform you, Tux, but your treason ends now."

"You act as if you are rebelling against the Fish Tax, but we know what "

"Citizens of Icy Island,\n"

"Beginning on Ice-date 542-7-3, Icy Island is now the domain of the Snow "

"Fire can be a great way to melt ice blocking access to certain Tux dolls. "
"Now, where can one find a fire flower around here?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Traveller's Note:\n"
"\n"
"I swear, there are no fire flowers anywhere in this level! How am I "

"Studies have shown that penguins have the ability to kick iceblocks, and "

"That pipe to the right is too high to be reached even by jumping off a "
"spring. It would be possible if that Jumpy could be magically suspended in "
"the air and the spring placed on top, but that would be silly!"

msgid ""
"You'll need a friend to find the Tux doll in this castle, in more ways "
"than one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please do NOT touch my rocks! For example, do NOT use them to build a "
"bridge allowing you to cross spike pits, and do NOT use them to build a "
"tower so that you can reach higher places."
